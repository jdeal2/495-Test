There are four scenes in the project, and they should all work without having to change any settings when switching between them. There should never be any errors.

The scenes should each be able to do a few things:

Every cube in the scene should get colored some color. The exact color isn't too important, you can change them if you want, but no cube should stay white.

Pressing spacebar should cycle through cube selection (if there is more than one group, more than one cube might be selected at a time). If the last cube is selected when spacebar is pressed, the selection should loop back to the beginning or go back in the other direction.

Pressing up or down should move the selected cube up or down in the y axis.

If you have to change the scene to avoid an error, okay, but it would be better if you found a way to avoid errors by changing only code.


Avoiding errors and getting everything working is the main priority, but keep in mind the coding standards posted on the test web page:
